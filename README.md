# Monday Meeting Randomizer

A randomizer for **finding a moderator for the monday meeting** (or digital meetings in general)

## Description

When we have our regular online meeting it's always the question **who moderates the meeting**. 
Since you can not flip a coin for a group of people and we have anyways a lot to decide,
i made this **Monday Meeting Randomizer**!

It has preconfigured list of names, but you can also **add new names** on the spot.
Before you start the randomization, you can also **uncheck the boxes** left of the names,
if people are absent.

Then start the randomization and the fun begins!
